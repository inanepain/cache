Some simple caching tools implementing link:https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-6[`PSR-6`] and link:https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-16[`PSR-16`].

== Goals

There is a lot to cover here so best I keep a bit of a record so as not to let bits fall between the cracks. As a bonus, a record will help keep me focus on the goal as well as track progress.

=== Primary Goal

To reduce remote access when using internet sourced data.

== Example

Basic example creating a `RemoteFileCache` object and using it. Using the defaults any subsequent requests, within a  one day period for the same url, retrieves content from cache.
